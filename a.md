** I will attach some pictures for reference. **

Once you arrive at the property, you'll see house with grey fencing.
The house has 2 car gates, and a pedestrian entrance in the middle.
The Airbnb's entrance is the left side motor gate.

## Self check-in

Just next to the motor gate on the right side you'll see a small metal lock box, and a green post box labelled 60 A.

The gate's remote is inside the lock box.

The code for the lock box is:

**Airbnb displayed your phone number after you confirmed your booking, I'm just used the last 4 digits. **

# To open the lock box

1. Pull down the handle to reveal the keypad
2. Set the code to 9112
3. Pull the little black switch downward. This will open the lock box. The switch is on the left side of the keypad
4. Take out the remote and home keys.
5. Close the lock box and just scramble the number again.

# To enter your place

The blue button on the remote will open the gate.
After the gate is open, close the gate by pressing the blue button again.
The remote has 4 buttons, only the blue button is operational, the other 3 is not connected to anything.

You'll see white and blue steps, leading up to the entrance.

You'll use 2 keys to open.

First, open the white security gate with the security gate key.

Next, insert the latch key and turn it clockwise. Hold it in the clockwise position and open the door by the handle.
