# vf (18 Dec 2022)

- Dev tools (and possibly F12 tools) slows down the instantness of the vue app, esp when using VF
- when i used component-is, perf on page 2 was slow. when i changed to to put all page cmps on the page and using active index, 4-finger textbox performance was better
- page 3 now was performing bad (4 fingers), but i think it had to do with the errors that page had (eg. store was being used)
